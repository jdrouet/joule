# Joule

This tool was made for monitoring the energy consumption of command, the same way the command `time` monitors the time used by a command.

## Howto use it

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jdrouet/joule
# go into the repository folder
cd joule
# build it
cargo build --release
# use it
sudo ./target/release/joule make real-music
```

You need to be a super user to execute that command, to access the powercap files.
